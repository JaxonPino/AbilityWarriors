If anyone wants to make this game better dm me on instagram(jaxon.pino) or discord(pinoy0299) 
Im trying to make a fun game to play and maybe include multiplayer and tournaments for money
So if you want to help develop multiplayer we will include a tournament for all that helped prob 100$
will eventually make this a site when it better
School sucks :<


// Ps this is the area for stuff I needed in this game;
-Multiplayer
-summon animation(maybe pachinko like hakari?)
-attacking animations(pngs or maybe different attacks show like a mini rasengan)
-difficulties
-better visuals?
-background music(anime openings in the back?
